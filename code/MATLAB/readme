Image_augment.m: we augment images from 200 to 1200. Another file (imageAugmen.ipynb) augments these 1200 images to 2400


ExtractHarris.m and 
findLocalMaximum.m: we use them to detect harris corner (help to generate positive samples for ship head classification) 


shipheadnegative.m: we generate negative samples for ship head classification


shipheadwith8direction.m: we generate positive samples for ship head classification


shipbodyROIreg.m: generate samples for ship localization


shipbodyROIregstep2.m: compute the regression target and classification target for the samples generated from shipbodyROIreg.m


ValicateDetectionResult.m: compute the IoU, precision, recall for the detection result


Notice: make sure the path for images or samples is correct in your computer.
